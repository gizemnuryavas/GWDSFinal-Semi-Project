        <h3 class="headerbackground">Report</h3>
        <p class="report">I had an experience with Adobe programs before beginning this course. And module was including a lot of
            things that I enjoyed doing it. So I was completely sure it would be enjoyable.</p>

            <p class="report">
            When I first started working on my website, I wanted to avoid having to scroll too much and to be able to
            access everything with a single click.
            I also wanted it to be simple while still reflecting my style. Because I use an analog camera, I thought a
            collage of my photos would look nice in the background. However, when the background was not a single color,
            the text was difficult to read. I still did not want to go with a monochrome background. So I went with
            something less complicated but still fit my style.</p>

            <p class="report">
            I have always loved designing things like posters. So I did not think I would ever be challenged on the CARP
            task. But it was arguably the most challenging part of the project for me. I had difficulties with
            creativity and I realized I did not have enough knowledge for the designs I wanted to make. After trying
            many things, I decided on a simpler design than I expected.</p>
            <p class="report">
            Even though I had never worked with HTML/CSS before, doing the worksheets was my favorite part of the
            course. The worksheets taught me a lot of new information about coding and aided me in creating this
            website.</p>
            <p class="report">
            I learned typographic systems for the first time. At first, I had a hard time deciding on the designs. I was
            changing the designs constantly. After a while, I began to draw on a piece of paper the design I wanted to
            do based on Mary's advice. And it worked so well and made my job so much easier.</p>
            <p class="report">
            When I started my UX task, I was not sure about the main page right away. But I had the layout of the other
            pages planned out in my head. When creating my website, I stuck to the wireframes I made initially. The main
            page was changed because there was a difference between what I thought would look good and what did. That's
            why, once I was satisfied with the outcome, I edited the wireframe I did for my main page.</p>
            <p class="report">
            As a result, this project challenged me a lot. There were times when I could not move forward because I
            wanted everything to be perfect. My greatest fear was completing an assignment below my potential. But I
            made a peace with that eventually. My aim become to complete this process in a pleasant way, not a difficult
            one. So I am pretty happy with where I am now and I think I have learned a lot of new things.</p>
